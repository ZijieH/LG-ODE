# LG-ODE

LG-ODE is an overall framework for learning continuous multi-agent system dynamics from irregularly-sampled partial observations considering graph structure.

You can see our Neurips 2020 paper [“**Learning Continuous System Dynamics from Irregularly-Sampled Partial Observations**”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03880) for more details.

This implementation of LG-ODE is based on [Pytorch Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) API.
## Data Generation

Generate simulated datasets (spring, charged particles) by running:

```bash
cd data
python generate_dataset.py 
```

This generates the springs dataset, use `--simulation charged` for charged particles. 

As simulated data is too large, we provide a toy-data from spring dataset and can be found under `data/example_data` 

Motion dataset can be downloaded [CMU MoCap](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/) 



## Setup

This implementation is based on pytorch_geometric. To run the code, you need the following dependencies:

* [Python 3.6.10](https://www.python.org/)

- [Pytorch 1.4.0](https://pytorch.org/)

- [pytorch_geometric 1.4.3](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/)

  - torch-cluster==1.5.3
  - torch-scatter==2.0.4
  - torch-sparse==0.6.1

- [torchdiffeq 0.0.1](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq)

- [numpy 1.16.1](https://numpy.org/)


## Usage
Execute the following scripts to train on the sampled data from spring system:

```bash
python run_models.py
```

There are some key options of this scrips:

- `--sample-percent-train`: This is the observed percentage in your training data.

- `--sample-percent-test`: This is the observed percentage in your testing data.

- `--solver` : This is for choosing your ODE Solver.

- `--extrap`: Set True to run in the extrapolation mode, otherwise run in the interpolation mode.


The details of other optional hyperparameters can be found in run_models.py.
